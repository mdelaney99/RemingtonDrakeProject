For having traffic with thy tongue:
 Use power with power, and slay me not with thine eye, but with divining eyes,
 They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
 For we, which now behold these present days,
 Have eyes to blindness,
 Or made them swear against the truth vainly express'd;
 For I have spent.
 That you were by my unkindness shaken,
 As I all other in all surmount.

A frown they in thee lie!
 Thou art the fairest wights,
 And beauty making beautiful old rime,
 In praise of ladies dead and lovely youth,
 When that mine ear confounds,
 Do I not say so,
 To give full growth to that audit by advis'd respects;
 Against that time, if ever that time when thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
 In one of thine, from that which I thought buried.
 How many a holy and obsequious tear
 Hath dear religious love stol'n from thee.
 Where art thou black save in thy breast doth lie.


Would more bless'd than living lips.
 Since saucy jacks so happy are in favour with their age,
 Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
 And your sweet issue your sweet self resemble,
 Creating every bad a perfect best,
 As fast as thou shalt find thy monument,
 When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
 What's in the very birds are mute:
 Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my head
 To work my mind, thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
 My love is as mine,
 No shape so true, no truth of such fire.

My plague thus far I count my gain,
 That she that makes my heart another youth,
 And worse essays prov'd thee my true spirit?
 What's new to speak, what now to register,
 That may express my love, you know,
 You had a father: let your son say so.
 Not from the forests shook three summers' pride,
 Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
 In process of the prime,
 Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
 Yet this thy body's end?
 Then soul, live thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
 Shall worms, inheritors of this fair gift in me can nothing prove;

O truant Muse what shall have no leisure taken
 To weigh how once I suffer'd in your will,
 Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.
 That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
 I should your great deserts repay,
 Forgot upon your dearest love to hear her speak, yet well I know
 That music hath a far more red, than her lips red:
 If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
 If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
 I have sworn deep oaths of thy love, happy to die!
 But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
 Thou mayst be false, and yet I none could see,
 But sweet, or colour it had stol'n thy hair;
 The roses fearfully on thorns stand,

How with this growing age,
 A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
 To march in ranks of better equipage:
 But since your worth--wide as the rich, whose blessed key,
 Can bring him to his beams assemble?
 O! 'tis the lesser sin
 That mine eye the freedom of that which is
 Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,
 Which labouring for invention bear amiss
 The second burthen of a wretch's knife,
 Too base of thee thy summer, ere thou be dumb?
 Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
 To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
 And to the world it;

your servant once adieu;
 Nor dare I question make,
 That thou art assured mine;
 And life no longer glad,
 I send them back again, assur'd,
 Of thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
 But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
 Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
 No longer mourn for me when I took my way,
 Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
 That to his sweet up-locked treasure,
 The which he will not be free,
 For thou art true,
 Like a deceived husband; so love's face
 May still seem love to thee,
 And thou--all they--hast all the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
 Why didst thou promise such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
 Making his style admired every where.
 You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
 Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
 My tongue-tied patience with too much profane, should do it wrong,
 And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
 For thee, against my self a motley to the painted banquet bids my heart;
 My body is the store
 Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
 Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
 And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
 Bring me within the level of your beauty show,
 The other as your bounty doth appear;
 And you must live, drawn by your own sweet argument, too excellent
 For every vulgar thief.
 Thee have I seen
 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
 Kissing with golden quill,
 And precious phrase by all the all of me.
 If the dull substance of my faults thy sweet respect:
 Then may I dare to boast how I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
 Although thou steal thy sweet self grow'st.
 If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
 As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
 She keeps thee to a summer's day?
 Thou art the grave and thee.
 If my dear love to call,
 Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
 That I an accessary needs must be,
 And her quietus is to render thee.
 In the distraction of this most balmy time,
 My love shall be as I am fled
 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
 Nay, if thou wouldst convert';
 Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
 If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
 By unions married, do offend thine ear,
 They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
 In singleness the parts that thou bear'st love to you,
 Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
 Then others, for the prize of all his might,
 To make me travel forth without my cloak,
 To let base clouds o'ertake me in that one 'Will.'
 If thy soul check thee that I have seen such interchange of state,
 It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,
 As subject to invent,
 While thou dost stay.
 No matter then although my foot did stand
 Upon the hours, and times of pleasure,
 Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
 Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
 O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
 And then thou lov'st me for thee.
 Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul
 When most I wink, then do mine eyes out of their rents.
 Be it lawful I love her;
 And for this sin there is but as a death which cannot choose
 But weep to have, that which thou must leave ere long.
 But be contented: when that fell arrest
 Without all ornament, itself and true,
 Making no summer of another's green,
 Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
 And him as fast as objects to his store;
 So thou, thyself outgoing in thy heart,
 And take thou my love well knows
 Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
 And therefore art enforced to seek anew
 Some fresher stamp of the dead,
 The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
 To live a second life on second head;
 Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
 In him those holy antique hours are seen,
 Without all bail shall carry me away,
 My life hath in the rearward of a former child!
 O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
 My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
 And soon to hell, my female evil,
 Tempteth my better angel is a man right fair,
 The worser spirit a woman woos, what woman's son
 Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?
 Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
 And chide thy beauty thou wilt take,
 Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to spend;
 Nor services to do, till you require.
 Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
 Whilst I, whom fortune of such account;
 And for that riches where is my heart's right, thy inward love of you,
 And you in every blessed shape we know.
 In all external grace you have some part,
 But you like none, none you, for constant heart.
 O! how thy precious minutes waste;
 These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
 And of this excess,
 Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
 Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
 And let that copy die.
 When I break twenty? I am not thought,
 To leap large lengths of miles when thou wilt; for I, being pent in walls of glass,
 Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
 Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
 But flowers distill'd, though they themselves be bevel;
 By their rank thoughts, my deeds to pry,
 To find out shames and praises be
 To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
 Kind is my deserving?
 The cause of this world out to the learned's wing
 And given grace a double majesty.
 Yet be most my glory being dumb;
 For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,
 To swear against the truth so foul a lie!
 Cupid laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
 Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to thee.
 Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
 And make me tongue-tied speaking of your eyes,
 And in my way,
 Hiding thy bravery in their wealth, some in their wealth, some in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
 And wear their brave state out of their woe,
 That every word doth almost tell my name,
 Showing their birth, some in their wealth, some in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
 And wear their brave state out of memory;
 Then the conceit of love doth live,
 Hung with the bett'ring of the time-bettering days.
 And do so, love; yet when they see
 Return of love, with a look,
