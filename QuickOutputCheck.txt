For having traffic with thy tongue:
 Use power with power, and slay me not with thine eye, but with divining eyes,
 They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
 For we, which now behold these present days,
 Have eyes to blindness,
 Or made them swear against the truth vainly express'd;
 For I have spent.
 That you were by my unkindness shaken,
 As I all other in all surmount.

A frown they in thee lie!
 Thou art the fairest wights,
 And beauty making beautiful old rime,
 In praise of ladies dead and lovely youth,
 When that mine ear confounds,
 Do I not say so,
 To give full growth to that audit by advis'd respects;
 Against that time, if ever that time when thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
 In one of thine, from that which I thought buried.
 How many a holy and obsequious tear
 Hath dear religious love stol'n from thee.
 Where art thou black save in thy breast doth lie.


Would more bless'd than living lips.
 Since saucy jacks so happy are in favour with their age,
 Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
 And your sweet issue your sweet self resemble,
 Creating every bad a perfect best,
 As fast as thou shalt find thy monument,
 When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
 What's in the very birds are mute:
 Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my head
 To work my mind, thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
 My love is as mine,
 No shape so true, no truth of such fire.

My plague thus far I count my gain,
 That she that makes my heart another youth,
 And worse essays prov'd thee my true spirit?
 What's new to speak, what now to register,
 That may express my love, you know,
 You had a father: let your son say so.
 Not from the forests shook three summers' pride,
 Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
 In process of the prime,
 Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
 Yet this thy body's end?
 Then soul, live thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
 Shall worms, inheritors of this fair gift in me can nothing prove;
